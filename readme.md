This is one of my learning project. I created this by following the tutorials of React For Beginners â€” [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com) by Wes Bos.

So, if anyone of yoo would like to learn how the data management in React Js is, I recommend this course, of course you have to purchase it. Through this course I've learnt React JS, React Router, how to manage state and save it in localStorage as well as in Firebase, then authentication, and finally deploy it some hosting services.
